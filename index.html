                <h3>Fun fact about my self</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="section_funfact">
                <p>One of the most interesting and somewhat funny facts about me is that I once had a three-year
                    relationship in one of the strictest schools imaginable. This was not just any regular school — it
                    was a highly disciplined boarding school where students were not allowed to use mobile phones, and
                    romantic relationships were completely forbidden. If the school found out that a student was in a
                    relationship, the punishment could be as severe as expulsion. On top of that, the workload and
                    academic pressure were intense, with constant monitoring and regular evaluations.
                    Despite all these restrictions, I started dating someone in grade 10, and we managed to keep the
                    relationship going all the way until the end of grade 12. It was not easy at all. We had to be very
                    creative to communicate and spend time together without getting caught. Small gestures like
                    exchanging handwritten notes or finding a quiet corner during break time meant a lot. It was like
                    living in our own secret little world inside a strict and controlled environment.
                    After graduating, we were finally free from the school rules, and we thought our relationship would
                    only get stronger. Ironically, just four months after leaving school, we broke up. Looking back, I
                    find it both amusing and memorable — we survived three years of strict rules and secrecy, only to
                    part ways when we had complete freedom. It taught me that sometimes the challenge is what makes a
                    story exciting, and even though it ended, it’s still a chapter of my life that makes people smile
                    when they hear it.

                <h3>Unique skills that I have learned</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="section_skill">
                <p>One of my most unique skills is my incredibly fast typing speed. Over the years, I have developed the
                    ability to type with great accuracy and efficiency, often surprising others with how quickly I can
                    produce written content without losing focus. This skill has been useful in many areas, such as
                    completing assignments on time, chatting with friends, and even working on coding projects. It saves
                    me a lot of time and allows me to think and write almost simultaneously. Another unique skill I have
                    is my ability to master any game quickly. When I was younger, I would try different types of games —
                    from strategy to first-person shooters — and within a short time, I could play them at a competitive
                    level. This comes from my habit of quickly identifying patterns, understanding game mechanics, and
                    adapting my strategies based on the situation. Both of these skills — fast typing and quick game
                    mastery — are not only fun but also demonstrate my adaptability and focus. Even though I do not play
                    games as much now, the mental agility I developed from them still benefits me in other areas of
                    life, such as problem-solving and learning new tools.</p>

                <h3>Unique skills that I'm pursuing</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="section_skill">
                <p>The skill I am currently pursuing is the ability to understand technical terms and code extremely
                    quickly. As a student in the IT field, I often come across complex programming concepts, unfamiliar
                    frameworks, and technical documentation that can be difficult to understand at first. My goal is to
                    reach a level where I can read and interpret these materials with ease, just like how I can type or
                    play games quickly. I believe this skill will allow me to become much more productive as a
                    programmer because I will spend less time trying to figure out what something means and more time
                    actually building solutions. To develop this skill, I am exposing myself to a wide range of
                    programming languages and reading more technical blogs, open-source code, and developer
                    documentation. I also practice by reading code from GitHub projects and trying to explain it in my
                    own words. This way, I can train my brain to instantly recognize patterns and meanings in code. In
                    the future, this skill will be essential for me to work efficiently in the tech industry, where
                    speed and understanding are key to solving problems and delivering high-quality software.</p>
