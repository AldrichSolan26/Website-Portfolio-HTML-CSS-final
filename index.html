                        I consider every day an opportunity to enrich my life. I enjoy cooking, coding, and watching
                        romantic films in my free time. In addition, I am enthusiastic about playing basketball, which
                        helps me maintain both physical fitness and teamwork skills.

                    <p>
                        I studied at Foreign Trade University (FTU) for one year before transferring to the University
                        of Technology Sydney (UTS), where I am currently pursuing my degree.

                    <h3>Some fun facts about myself</h3>
                    <p>One of the most interesting and somewhat ironic facts about me is my academic journey back in
                        Vietnam. I once studied in one of the most rigorous and competitive environments designed
                        specifically to train students for the national exams in Math, Physics, and English. The
                        atmosphere was highly disciplined, with long study hours, constant practice tests, and a culture
                        where academic achievement was everything. It was the kind of place where students were pushed
                        to their limits in order to secure a place in top universities. After years of effort and
                        dedication, I succeeded in earning a slot at Foreign Trade University — one of the most
                        prestigious economics institutions in southern Vietnam. Not only that, I was
                        admitted into the elite high-quality Business Administration program, which was considered a
                        significant accomplishment. At that time, it felt like the natural and expected outcome of the
                        environment I had been trained in, and for many people around me, it would have been the final
                        goal. But here comes the twist: despite all that preparation and achievement in economics and
                        business, I made a completely different choice. Instead of pursuing the traditional path, I
                        decided to study abroad in Australia and major in Information Technology. It was a decision that
                        surprised many people, given the years of effort I had invested in another direction, but to me
                        it was both exciting and liberating. Looking back, I find it both amusing and meaningful. All
                        the training and discipline I went through shaped my mindset and resilience, even though I ended
                        up taking a different path. It
                        taught me that life is not always about following the most predictable route. Sometimes, the
                        detour becomes the real journey — and in my case, choosing IT in Australia is a story that
                        always makes people smile when they hear how unexpectedly it all turned out.

                <div class="layout_skills_learned">
                    <p>One of the unique skills I have learned is playing the piano. Through regular practice, I have
                        developed the ability to play with speed and accuracy, which has improved my coordination,
                        focus,
                        and sense of timing. </p>

                <div class="layout_skills_learned" style="flex-direction:row-reverse;">
                    <p>Another skill I have mastered is using computers and keyboards efficiently. I can type quickly
                        and
                        accurately, navigate software smoothly, and apply these abilities to various tasks, from coding
                        projects to writing assignments. This skill saves time and enhances productivity in both
                        academic
                        and personal work. </p>

                <div class="layout_skills_learned">
                    <p>In addition, I have developed strong cooking skills. Over time, I have learned to prepare a wide
                        range of dishes that are both delicious and well-presented. Cooking has taught me creativity,
                        attention to detail, and problem-solving, especially when experimenting with new recipes or
                        ingredients. </p>

                        Together, these skills — piano, computer proficiency, and cooking — demonstrate my

                        personal and academic life.

                <p>The skill I am currently pursuing is the ability to understand technical terms and code extremely
                    quickly. As a student in the IT field, I often come across complex programming concepts, unfamiliar
                    frameworks, and technical documentation that can be difficult to understand at first. My goal is to
                    reach a level where I can read and interpret these materials with ease, just like how I can type or
                    play games quickly. I believe this skill will allow me to become much more productive as a
                    programmer because I will spend less time trying to figure out what something means and more time
                    actually building solutions. To develop this skill, I am exposing myself to a wide range of
                    programming languages and reading more technical blogs, open-source code, and developer
                    documentation. I also practice by reading code from GitHub projects and trying to explain it in my
                    own words. In doing so, I am enhancing my ability to instantly recognize structural patterns and
                    underlying logic in programming. In
                    the future, this skill will be essential for me to work efficiently in the tech industry, where
                    speed and understanding are key to solving problems and delivering high-quality software.</p>
