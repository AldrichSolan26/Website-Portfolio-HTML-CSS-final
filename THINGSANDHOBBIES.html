                When I was younger, my favourite thing in the world was video games. They were not just a source of
                entertainment but also a way for me to connect with my friends. I would spend hours playing online
                games, competing, and cooperating with people I knew in real life. It gave me a sense of excitement,
                achievement, and belonging. Playing games was also a way for me to relieve stress after school. The
                feeling of completing a difficult mission or winning a match always gave me a rush of dopamine. Games
                also improved my reaction time, strategic thinking, and ability to make quick decisions.
                However, as I grew older, my priorities changed. Nowadays, I rarely play games because I have more
                responsibilities, such as my studies and part-time work. I still appreciate games for the joy they
                brought me in the past, but I no longer feel the same urge to play for long hours. Despite this, I
                believe that gaming has shaped my personality and thinking style. It taught me about perseverance,
                teamwork, and adaptability â€” lessons that are still useful today. Even though my passion for gaming has
                faded, I still hold fond memories of the times when games were a big part of my life.
