                <p>
                    When I was younger, my favourite thing in the world was video games. They were not just a source of
                    entertainment but also a way for me to connect with my friends. I would spend hours playing online
                    games, competing, and cooperating with people I knew in real life. It gave me a sense of excitement,
                    achievement, and belonging. Playing games was also a way for me to relieve stress after school. The
                    feeling of completing a difficult mission or winning a match always gave me a rush of dopamine.
                    Games
                    also improved my reaction time, strategic thinking, and ability to make quick decisions.
                    However, as I grew older, my priorities changed. Nowadays, I rarely play games because I have more
                    responsibilities, such as my studies and part-time work. I still appreciate games for the joy they
                    brought me in the past, but I no longer feel the same urge to play for long hours. Despite this, I
                    believe that gaming has shaped my personality and thinking style. It taught me about perseverance,
                    teamwork, and adaptability — lessons that are still useful today. Even though my passion for gaming
                    has
                    faded, I still hold fond memories of the times when games were a big part of my life.

                <p>
                    One of my favourite activities is playing basketball. I first got into basketball through my
                    friends, who invited me to join a casual game after school. At first, I was not very good, but the
                    more I played, the more I enjoyed it. Basketball gives me a similar rush of dopamine to playing
                    video games, but it also allows me to be physically active. I love the energy of the game — the fast
                    pace, the need for quick decision-making, and the feeling of scoring a basket after a good play.
                    What makes basketball special to me is the social aspect. Playing with friends builds strong bonds
                    because we have to communicate, support each other, and work together to win. It’s also a great way
                    to relieve stress and stay fit at the same time. Unlike gaming, basketball gets me outdoors and
                    moving, which is refreshing after spending hours studying or working on a computer. Over time, I
                    have learned various techniques and strategies, and I enjoy challenging myself to improve. Whether
                    I'm playing competitively or just for fun, basketball always leaves me feeling energized and happy.
